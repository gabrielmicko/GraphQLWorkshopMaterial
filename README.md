## GraphQL Workshop

### Task 1

#### Install dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```

I've created a file in "src/model/file.js". Later on this file will help you to feed the GraphQL resolvers.
Meaning that it will return some data according to given parameters.
Your task is to write the function logic according to the documentation.

#### Hints:
- "src/db" has two JSON files which you need.
- You might want to use .filter function in some of the functions.
- All of the function are synchrounous.


#### Testing:
When you are done, please run this command:

```bash
yarn run test
```

Or if you want to run the test on every change run this command:

```bash
yarn run test:watch
```

##### Good luck!
