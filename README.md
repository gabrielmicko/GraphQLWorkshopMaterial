## GraphQL Workshop

### Task 6

You are AMAZING ðŸ˜±. Let's put it together now. As we did in the first task, we need to write a model. We are not going to use the old file model anymore, but we are going to keep the same structure and functions. Open "src/model/db.js". You'll see, no magic there ðŸŽ©.
Your task is to write the logic for the functions by using the "src/model/helper.js". Some details you might already know. Database name is jsdays. The two tables are speakers and talks. When you are ready the final step is to replace the path for your model in "src/resolvers/index.js".
If you have done everything right and the tests are passing you should run the GraphQL server and check your results manually.


#### Hints:
- Make sure to seed at least once, before running the tests.
- Before you test, make sure to change the path of the resolver to use the new model.
- Don't forget that you need to provide a live connection to the model, always. Use getConnection() (ie: getTalks function).


#### Running the GraphQL server:
```bash
yarn run graphql
```

#### Testing:
When you are done, please run this command:

```bash
yarn run test
```

Or if you want to run the test on every change run this command:

```bash
yarn run test:watch
```

#### Seed:
```bash
yarn run seed
```

##### Good luck!
